### This file includes competition docement and modeling work of our team- Venus Capital.
#### Our team is honored to be selected in top 25 in the globe for our brilliant asset allocation decision and pension fund strategy.



The portfolio model includes following features:

1. Adjustable Mean Varuiance Portfolio Model => Calculate Max sharp ratio, Max return, or Min Volatility, allocate weight 
	a. If no weight restriction on each asset, certain assets may weight to zero
	b. Give each assets' category weights (ex: Stocks 70%, Bonds 20%, REITS 10%)
	c. Give each asset minimum bar (ex: AAPL 1%)
	d. Combine 2 and 3

2. The Adjusted Top-Down portfolio model includes all possible combinatons for given range in each asset.(Ex: AAPL 3% ~ 5%)


3. Output :
	a. Weight vector for the portfolio
	b. Annual Return
	c. Annual Volatility
	d. Sharpe Ratio
	e. Maximum drawdown

Future work:
	1. Draw mean variance efficient frontier figure for better visualization
	2. Try multiple asset allocation methods



The pension simulation model-cash flow includes following features:

1. Simulate pension fund cash flow movement by giving following variables:
	a. Number of people join in each year
	b. Each starting Salary when join the pension fund
	c. Dynamic reserve contribution rate for different years
	
Future work:
	1. Try add multiple joining years formula
