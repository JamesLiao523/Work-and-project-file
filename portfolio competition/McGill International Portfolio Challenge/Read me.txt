The portfolio model includes following features:

1. Adjustable Mean Varuiance Portfolio Model => Calculate Max sharp ratio, Max return, or Min Volatility, allocate weight 
	1. If no weight restriction on each asset, certain assets may weight to zero
	2. Give each assets' category weights (ex: Stocks 70%, Bonds 20%, REITS 10%)
	3. Give each asset minimum bar (ex: AAPL 1%)
	4. Combine 2 and 3
2. Output :
	1. Weight vector for the portfolio
	2. Annual Return
	3. Annual Volatility
	4. Sharpe Ratio
	5. Maximum drawdown


Future work:
	1. Draw mean variance efficient frontier figure for better visualization
	2. Try multiple asset allocation methods
