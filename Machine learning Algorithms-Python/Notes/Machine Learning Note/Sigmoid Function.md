#### Defination:
> - A special form of the logistic function. 
> - The range is (0, 1)
> - The function is monotonically increasing
> - The function is continuous and differentiable


> Formula:
> $$f(x) =  \frac {1} {1 + e^{-x}}$$
#### Pros and Cons
> Pros:
> - Outputs can serve as probability (0, 1)
> - Data doesn't diverse easily when passing
> - Easy for Derivative
> 
> Cons:
> - Hard to converge when using gradient search
