#### Why using it?
> -  If not using it, the output will only have linear relationship to the input, like Perceptron Model.   ( <- Array Multiplication in each layer only)
> 
> - If using it, neural network is able to approach any non-linear relationship.



####  Common Activation Function:
> - Sigmoid Function
> - Tanh Function
> - ReLu Function
